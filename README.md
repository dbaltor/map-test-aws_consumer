# Denis map-test AWS Consumer 2018
Test map application developed with Spring Boot and AWS SQS (Simple Queue Service) and SNS (Simple Notification Service).
<br>MAP_KEY environment variable must be set with the LocationIQ map token.

A small application that updates the UK map based on 2 independent continuous streams of events: 
1) around 20000 risk areas (Heat map) updated every 10 seconds (reload required to keeping tracking afterwards).
2) 100 moving vehicles updated every 2 seconds.

The risk areas are generated by the companion application "Denis map-test AWS Supplier" and transmitted asynchronously via AWS SNS and SQS services.
